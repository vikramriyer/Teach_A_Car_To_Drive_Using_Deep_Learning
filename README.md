Overview
---
This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, we will use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. The model we train using Keras will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report
